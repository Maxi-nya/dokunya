Dokunyaüêæ

**Dokunya** is a puzzle game inspired by ''Sudoku'' and the ''Monster Hunter'' series.  
Players must fill a 3x3 grid where each cell represents a unique combination of monster attributes.
The challenge is to name monsters that match the criteria while avoiding repeats.

Features (Planned)
- Daily grid with randomized monster category combinations
- Multiple valid answers per cell, but each monster can be used only once
- Personal Hunter Journal / Guild Card (encyclopedia of discovered monsters)
- Scoring based on answer rarity and accuracy

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a **work-in-progress prototype**, not intended for public release at this stage.
